h2. ActiveEnhancements

This is a collection of ActiveRecord enhancements we use a lot. It's not a biggie, too. Quite useful. ;-)

h2. Example

*revert*

If you have a collection of database entries you wanna throw away and revert only the data instead of using 
the migration tasks to revert you could use it like that:

<code>
	reverted = Group.revert
</code>

It deletes all entries in the associated table and sets AUTO_INCREMENT to 1. Quite useful if the id is important.

*collectable*

This is nice to use for array that you have to use for selectbox items. Simply add the attributes you want to collect
has hash:

<code>
	@products = Product.collectable(:identifier,:id)
</code>

*destroy_by_attributes*

Sometimes you want to destroy database entries without giving the id. Maybe, because you do not know ?

<code>
	NetworkProductJoin.destroy_by_attributes({:network_id => entry.network_id, :product_id => @product.id})
</code>

*find_or_create*

This is an enhancement to the magical find methods. 

<code>
	
	master = User.find_or_create({:login => "master", 
	                      :password => "one2three", 
	                      :password_confirmation => "one2three", 
	                      :email => "master@foo.com",
	                      :active => true})
	
</code>

Very useful if you have to seed your database.
